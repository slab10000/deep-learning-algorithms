Welcome to my repository for Deep Learning and Machine Learning algorithms! 🚀

This repository serves as a personal playground and portfolio where I upload code to practice, experiment with, and master various algorithms and frameworks. It is currently **under active development**, and new models and implementations will be added regularly.

## 📂 Repository Contents

Here is an overview of what has been implemented so far:

### 🧠 Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- **Conditional GANs (CGANs)**: Implementation of Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks used for generating data (e.g., MNIST images) conditioned on class labels. 
  - Location: `GANs/CGANs.ipynb`

### 📈 Classification & Regression
Try it here: https://slab10000.github.io/deep-learning-algorithms/classification-and-regression/
Applied machine learning projects covering both classification and regression tasks.

- **Classification - Petfinder Dataset**: 
  - A project focusing on classifying pet adoption profiles.
  - Includes a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model saved in ONNX format (`mlp_net_model.onnx`).
  - Location: `classification-and-regression/classification/`

- **Regression - Songs Dataset**:
  - A regression analysis project, likely predicting song popularity or features.
  - Utilizes XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) and includes the serialized model (`xgboost_songs_model.onnx`).
  - Location: `classification-and-regression/regression/`

### 🔢 Tensor Operations
Foundational notebooks for understanding data manipulation and tensor math.

- **NumPy & PyTorch**: Introductory notebooks covering the basics of NumPy arrays and PyTorch tensor operations, essential for any Deep Learning workflow.
  - Location: `tensor-operations/`

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools with

- **Languages**: Python
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: PyTorch

Welcome to my repository for Deep Learning and Machine Learning algorithms! 🚀

This repository serves as a personal playground and portfolio where I upload code to practice, experiment with, and master various algorithms and frameworks. It is currently **under active development**, and new models and implementations will be added regularly.

## 📂 Repository Contents

Here is an overview of what has been implemented so far:

### 🧠 Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- **Conditional GANs (CGANs)**: Implementation of Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks used for generating data (e.g., MNIST images) conditioned on class labels. 
  - Location: `GANs/CGANs.ipynb`

### 📈 Classification & Regression

Applied machine learning projects covering both classification and regression tasks.

- **Classification - Petfinder Dataset**: 
  - A project focusing on classifying pet adoption profiles.
  - Includes a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model saved in ONNX format (`mlp_net_model.onnx`).
  - Location: `classification-and-regression/classification/`

- **Regression - Songs Dataset**:
  - A regression analysis project, likely predicting song popularity or features.
  - Utilizes XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) and includes the serialized model (`xgboost_songs_model.onnx`).
  - Location: `classification-and-regression/regression/`

### 🎬 Neural Input Optimization (NIO) - Movie Optimization
- **Project Blockbuster: NIO Optimisation for Movies**:
  - A project that uses Neural Input Optimization (NIO) to reverse-engineer the optimal movie blueprint for maximizing both commercial success (Gross Revenue) and critical acclaim (IMDB Score).
  - **Dataset**: IMDB 5000 Movie Dataset from Kaggle (~5000 movies, 28 features)
  - **Model Architecture**: Residual Neural Network (ResNet) implemented in PyTorch with residual connections and dropout regularization
  - **Optimization Goal**: Find optimal movie characteristics (Budget, Cast, Genre) that maximize Return on Investment (ROI = Gross/Budget) while maintaining:
    - IMDB Score between 9.0 and 10.0
    - Budget between $20M and $200M
  - **Key Results**: The NIO algorithm identified that a mid-range budget (~$110M) with high star power and specific genre combinations yields optimal ROI (9.09x) while maintaining critical acclaim
  - Location: `NIO/`

### 🖼️ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) - Shape Classification
- **Geometric Shape Classifier**:
  - A CNN-based image classification project that identifies geometric shapes by counting their number of sides (Triangles: 3, Squares: 4, Pentagons: 5, Hexagons: 6).
  - **Dataset**: 10,000 images of geometric shapes (128×128 pixels, resized to 64×64 for training) with corresponding labels in CSV format
  - **Model Architecture**: "ShapeClassifier" CNN with:
    - 3 convolutional layers (16 → 32 → 64 channels) with ReLU activation and MaxPooling
    - Fully connected layers (128 hidden units) with dropout (0.5) for regularization
    - 4-class output layer for shape classification
  - **Training**: 20 epochs with batch size 64, CrossEntropyLoss, Adam optimizer, GPU-accelerated
  - **Performance**: Achieved excellent results with:
    - Precision: 0.971
    - Recall: 0.971
    - F1 Score: 0.971
  - **Custom Dataset**: Implemented `ShapesDataset` class for loading images and mapping side counts to class indices
  - Location: `CNN/`

### 🔢 Tensor Operations
Foundational notebooks for understanding data manipulation and tensor math.

- **NumPy & PyTorch**: Introductory notebooks covering the basics of NumPy arrays and PyTorch tensor operations, essential for any Deep Learning workflow.
  - Location: `tensor-operations/`
